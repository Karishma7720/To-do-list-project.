Simple introduction aboout my to do list project.

1. One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised.
   When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable.
   When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve got to do and those you’ve completed, 
   it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks.

2. I have made such to do list using HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT.

3. where user can add  important things  , there is option to tick mark once completed and there is close button as well.

4. use can not click on add without entering any note.  else they will get an eorrr.

5. I have used css animation div tages and images/ colours to make it little attractive.
