 a to do list using HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT.  
I have made a to do list using HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT.
where user can add important things , there is option to mark completed and there is close button as well for the tasks.
user can not click on add without entering any note.
else they will get an error.
I have used CSS animation div tags and images/ colors to make it attractive and html and javascript as well.
